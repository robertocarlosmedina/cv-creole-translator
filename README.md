#  Cape Verdean Creole Translator Frontend test App
### _Machine Translation System (MT) Front-end Test App to test the different models run with human testing when doing MT tasks_


This is a React APP with an interface similar to [Google Translate] this MT system was made with the intention of testing the whole performance of the project when doing the translation using the configuration of different models.

> This project was made with the intention of being an integral part of my final final project.
> All aspects addressed in the implementation were made according to the needs of the project as a whole.
> Cape Verdean Creole is the mother language of Cape Verde, which is not an official language and is not well represented and known around the world. Therefore, it is a great honor to carry out studies and projects that contribute to its recognition and dissemination.


### Features

Once a sentence has been entered in the interface and according to the chosen model and also the source and target language, it will perform the task of translating this sentence. All this with the help of a [Restfull API] that is also an integral part of the project as a whole


### Dependencies

To install the dependencies run:
```sh
npm install
```


### Execution
To launch the APP on the browser execute: 
```sh
npm start
```


### All parts of the project into a whole
The whole project is divided into parts and each part has an essential function in it.
They are distributed as shown in the subtopics below.


#### Models implementation
This are the model used in the whole project:

- [Transformer model implementation]
- [GRU model implementation]
- [LSTM model implementation]
- [Models Training Graphs Generator]


#### Frontend test platform
This is a React App made to test all the translations made by the models, similar to the App [Google Translator]. 
Projects related to using the frontend application can be found at:

- [MT Models API implementation]
- [Cape Verdean Creole Translator Frontend test App]


#### Dataset
The dataset used to train, validate and test the model was the [CrioleSet dataset].
If the dataset is not in the project while executing any of the action commands, it will be downloaded and added to the project.

- [CrioleSet datset]
